# `field-scripts`
Shared scripts, tooling and utilities for the development environment and build process used by both farmOS Field Kit and its associated Field Modules. Powered by [Vite](https://vitejs.dev).

These are included in the dependencies when [`create-field-module`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jgaehring/create-field-module) is used to scaffold projects.
