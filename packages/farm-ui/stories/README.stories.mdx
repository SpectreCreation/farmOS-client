# farmOS Field Kit: Component Library
Welcome! This Storybook serves as the primary documentation for the component
library used by farmOS Field Kit and farmOS Field Modules. In it you will find 
live examples of all the Vue components available to module developers, along
with the props they accept and events they emit. The main documentation for
Field Kit can be found [in the GitHub repo](http://github.com/farmOS/field-kit/tree/develop/API.md).
For more information on Storybook, feel free to visit [their own docs](https://storybook.js.org/docs/vue/get-started/introduction). 
If you're new to Vue.js, also be sure to checkout their [docs on component basics](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components.html).

Apart from being documentation, this Storybook will serve as the main style
guide for Field Kit and Field Modules. Because each individual Field Module
comprises only a single experience in the larger app which is Field Kit, it is
important that together they present a cohesive user experience and set common
expectations. It is therefore encouraged that this guide be consulted regularly
when making decisions about how to craft your module's user experience.

## Design considerations
A significant inspiration for Field Kit is the [Braid Design System](https://seek-oss.github.io/braid-design-system/),
chiefly its [stance on whitespace](https://seek-oss.github.io/braid-design-system/foundations/layout):

> The guiding principle for layout in Braid is that components should not
provide surrounding white space. Instead, spacing between elements is owned
entirely by layout components. This approach ensures that the system is as
composable as possible while keeping white space completely predictable.

For more background on this design paradigm, checkout [Mark Dalgleish's talk (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnV1u67_yVg)
on how the SEEK team came to develop these principles.

Although our design system is not yet as developed as Braid's, we strive to
attain a similar level of composability, and you will see many shared elements
with Braid's system, such as the [`Stack`](https://seek-oss.github.io/braid-design-system/components/Stack)
and [`Inline`](https://seek-oss.github.io/braid-design-system/components/Inline)
components and the sharp distinction between layout and content components.

In addition to Braid, we also borrow heavily from the [Material Design System](https://material.io/).

## Using components
For ease of use, all components in this library have been [registered globally](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components-registration.html#Global-Registration).
To render them in your template, you merely need to add a tag, using the
kebab-case version of the component name, along with any props you might want to
add:

```html
<farm-chip>Tomatoes</farm-chip>
```

By convention, all base components are named with the `farm-` prefix, in
accordance with [Vue's style recommendations](https://vuejs.org/v2/style-guide/#Base-component-names-strongly-recommended).
Similarly, icon components use the `icon-` prefix.

It's strongly recommended that Field Modules adopt a similar prefix for all of
their components, to distinguish them while debugging. This could be the name of
your root component, as is done with the Precipitation module:

```
components/
|- Precipitation.vue
|- PrecipitationMenuBar.vue
|- PrecipitationWidget.vue
```

Unlike the components in this library, your module's components should be
[registered locally](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components-registration.html#Local-Registration).
