# all contexts unless otherwise overridden by more specific contexts.

  # Directory to change to before starting a build.
  # This is where we will look for package.json/.nvmrc/etc.
  # If not set, defaults to the root directory.

  # Directory that contains the deploy-ready HTML files and 
  # assets generated by the build. This is relative to the base
  # directory if one has been set, or the root directory if 
  # a base has not been set. This sample publishes the directory 
  # located at the absolute path "root/project/build-output"

  # Default build command.
  command = "npm run build"

# Production context: all deploys from the Production branch 
# set in your site’s Branches settings in the UI
# will inherit these settings.

# get scoped to contexts no matter where you define them in the file.
# For context-specific rules, use _headers or _redirects files,
# which are PER-DEPLOY.
